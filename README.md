# Node Random Color Generator Spring 2024

This is a random color generator application that generates random colors in the command line.

It works like this:

When a user enters 'node index.js' in the command line, a block of 31x9 '#' characters colored with a random color (using hex code, e.g. '#ff0000') should be generated.

In addition to 'node index.js', it should also be able to accept the request for a:

- hue (e.g. green or red or blue)
- luminosity (e.g. light or dark)

...and then generate random colors that match those choices.
